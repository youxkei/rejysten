- use pnpm instead of npm
- use `git <subcomand>` naturally
- when you `git commit`, first check `git diff` and `git diff --cached`
  - ignore previous output and always run these commands fresh before committing
  - NEVER use `--no-verify` to skip pre-commit hooks
  - when pre-commit hook failed, try `pnpm run fix` first
  - if pre-commit hook fails due to flaky tests, retry the commit
- NEVER use for loops in Bash — run commands directly
- when piping long command output through grep, first write output to a file with `tee`, then grep the file
- use `pnpm test` to run all test cases, `pnpm test/case "case title"` to run one case
  - always consider to run cases one by one first
  - pre-commit hook runs all tests, so they should all pass without any changes
  - use `pnpm test ${file}` to run tests in a file
- use `git restore` instead of `git checkout` to restore file content from commit
- use `pnpm tsc` for type check
- if test fails, add `console.log` to debug first to investigate the problem
  - use `createComputed` to trace the signal changes
  - NEVER stash/revert changes to check if a test was already failing — pre-commit hook guarantees all tests passed before changes. Always debug forward with console.log/createComputed
- use `pnpm lint` for lint
- for planning, always consider adding tests instead of manual testing
