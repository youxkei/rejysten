- use pnpm instead of npm
- when you `git commit`, first check `git diff` and `git diff --cached`
  - when pre-commit hook failed, try `pnpm run fix` first
- use `pnpm test` to run all test cases, `pnpm test/case "case title"` to run one case
  - always consider to run cases one by one first
  - pre-commit hook runs all tests, so they should all pass without any changes
- use `git restore` instead of `git checkout` to restore file content from commit
